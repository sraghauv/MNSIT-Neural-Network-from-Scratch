# MNSIT-Neural-Network-from-Scratch
First neural network of the MNSIT data set. I only used numpy and not tensorflow or pytorch to understand the basics of a neural network. The highest accuracy I have recieved is 95.04% on a test case. The neural network structure contains one hidden layer with ReLU as the activation function and softmax as the output layer.
